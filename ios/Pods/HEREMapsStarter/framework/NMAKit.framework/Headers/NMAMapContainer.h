/**
 * A container of `NMAMapObject` instances, containers can be added to a `NMAMapView`
 * instance.
 *
 * Applications can, as necessary, add or remove certain
 * types of `NMAMapObject` objects to or from a `NMAMapContainer` (refer to
 * `-addMapObject:` for details). A `NMAMapContainer` is also
 * useful for grouping together `NMAMapObject` objects to allow application operations
 * on entire groups of map objects without requiring an iterative approach to
 * inspecting or changing the state of each individual `NMAMapObject` (e.g. for changing
 * their visibility).
 *
 * You can use the `NMAMapObject.visible` property to control
 * whether the objects in the container are visible. If it's set to YES, then
 * the visibility settings of each map object in the container are used. But
 * unlike other map objects, `NMAMapContainer` does not support the use of
 * visibility masks, so you cannot set container visibility on a zoom level basis.
 *
 * @note The `zOrder` of an `NMAMapObject` instance in a container is relative only to other
 * `NMAMapObject` instances within the same container. Note that containers are derived
 * from `NMAMapObject` also have `zOrder`.

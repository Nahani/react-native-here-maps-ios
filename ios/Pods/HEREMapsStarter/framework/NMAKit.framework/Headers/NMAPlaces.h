/**
 * Represents a factory for creating places requests.
 *
 * The `NMAPlaces` service supports a variety of use cases that center
 * around two major features:
 *
 * - Place discovery - helps users find places that are relevant to them.
 *
 * - Place information retrieval - provides detailed information about places
 * in which users are interested.
 *
 * For place discovery, the `NMAPlaces` API supports two use cases from which
 * to choose according to the requirements for the application:
 *
 * - Search - finds places that match user-provided search terms.
 *
 * - Explore - guides users to relevant places nearby.
 *
 * The `NMAPlaces` API defines resources that represent entry points for
 * supported use cases, employing links to describe the application flow within
 * a particular use case.
 *
 * For example, the discovery request is an entry point to the `NMAPlaces`
 * API resource. When an application user submits a discovery request to the
 * search resource, the response contains, among other items, a list of links
 * to places or to place resources. Each referenced place might have rich
 * content associated with it, including ratings, images, reviews, editorials,
 * and owner content. Each place also contains references to related places, which
 * allow users to discover places relevant to or otherwise related to their
 * original search.
 *
 * @note `NMAPlaces` requires valid authentication credentials to be set via
 * `NMAApplicationContext`. If valid credentials are not present the API may not
 * function correctly or may stop functioning correctly in the future when server
 * side configurations change.
